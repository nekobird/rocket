# ðŸš€ Rocket 

Rocket is a foundational library for creating interactive web experiences.

**Warning**, At this stage of development we are not using semver for versioning.

## Why

Rocket provides a wide range of tools that cover many aspects of developing interactivity on the web. It is perfect for creating rapid prototypes and web-apps that require a lot of dynamic interactions. It can handle most of the heavy lifting so you can focus on your mission!

[See Documentation Here](./documentation/index.md) (Still in progress).
